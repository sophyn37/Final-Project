## Key Findings
In my analysis of Apple stock price predictions, all models demonstrated varied performance compared to the baseline predictor, 
highlighting the importance of appropriate model selection for time series forecasting. The models ranked in terms of performance 
are as follows: Holt-Winters with multiplicative seasonality, Holt-Winters with additive seasonality, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, ARIMA.
